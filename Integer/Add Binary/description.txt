Given two binary strings, return their sum (also a binary string).

The input strings are both non-empty and contains only characters 1 or 0.

Example 1:

Input: a = "11", b = "1"
Output: "100"
Example 2:

Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
Output: "10101"

Please note that no addition operation is allowed!

How to start? There is an interview tip for bit manipulation problems:
if you don't know how to start, start from computing XOR for your input data.
Strangely, that helps to go out for quite a lot of problems
