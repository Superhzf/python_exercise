A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top which represent the hours (0-11), and
the 6 LEDs on the bottom represent the minutes (0-59).

Each LED represents a zero or one, with the least significant bit on the right.

For example:

top: 8,4,2,1
bottom: 32,16,8,4,2,1

Given a non-negative integer n which represents the number of LEDs that
are currently on, return all possible times the watch could represent.
